Create a class named Rectangle with the following variables;
                   length
                   width
     Write a program that calculates the area and perimeter of the given rectangle.
                   Example:
                            length = 4.5
                            width = 2
                   Output:
						The area of the rectangle is 9.0
						The perimeter of the rectangle is 13.0

			Hint:
				Area of rectangle:
					area=length×width

				Perimeter of rectangle:
					perimeter=2×(length+width)
